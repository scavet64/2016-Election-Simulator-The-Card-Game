(Duplication | Enhancements duplicating | unchecked)
	When I had a single enhancement card in my hand (Air horn) and passed my turn, at the end of the AI's turn 
	another copy of the card was in my deck. I ended up with 5 Airhorn cards in my hand by the end of it.
	Unsure of root cause
	
(Enhancements | Enhancement plays not getting evaluated | unchecked)
	In a situation where a rare card was in play on the AI's field and the player held an enhancement card (Airhorn)
	The AI would not enter the enhancement conditional of the FindNextMove method.
	Unsure of root cause
	
(infinite loop | AI infinitely loops though moves | unchecked)
	Unsure if this is a turn that lasts an unusual amount of time or something that never ends.
	Random occurrence after first few turns
	Unsure of root cause
	
(IndexOutOfBounds | Recieve error when applying Action | unchecked)
	When the AI finds and trys to apply the action, an index out of bounds error is recieved. I believe it has something
	to do with the hand as the list index was size 1, same as the number of cards in hand.
